## Description

LeapUp is an endless game where the objective is to control a square and climb platforms as high as possible. The game features dynamically generated and positioned platforms made of blocks.

## Gameplay

- Control the square using arrow keys to navigate and space to jump.
- The square must land on the platforms to continue climbing.
- Be careful not to touche any red square, as it will result in the player losing the game.
- The game continues endlessly, with the difficulty increasing as the player progresses.

## Development

The game is developed in C# using the Unity 2021 engine. The platforms are procedurally created and dinamically positioned and changed to provide an endless gameplay experience getting harder as the player gets higher. The game uses physics-based mechanics for realistic movement and collision detection.
